    <h1> Hobbies </h1>
    <p> I am very much into the arts, ever since at the tender age of four, I always loved drawing anything from my family, cartoon characters and even my own original characters, At age seven, I started creating my own books by taping my illustrations together. As I got older, my drawing skills progressed up to when I learned digital art and graphic designing today. Acting is another hobby I enjoy, I've been singing on stage since elementary school, done  christmas plays, and started getting involved in musical clubs from 5th to the 10th grade.</p>
