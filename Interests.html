    <h1> Interests </h1>
    <p> I have a lot of interests that are so many choices to do for a career, especially in animation, voice-over work, and puppetry, all of these topics are combined with Nostalgia. As a pop culture geek, I always loved watching cartoons, movies and shows that have devoted fanbases, whether retro or modern. I remember my parents buying me the films and shows they grew up with back in the 1980s on dvd to see if I'd be entertained or interested, this lead me to my interest in voice acting and animation. Works of Jim Henson, The Muppets, Sesame Street and Fraggle Rock lead me to get into puppeteering and puppet building. Up til this very day, I value every example of nostalgia and will continue to through my career choices I have, bringing back cel animation, bringing characters, animated or in puppet form, to life in dream productions, and  continue to spread and keep Nostalgia alive.  </p>
